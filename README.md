Pareto's Law States that 80% of your OUTPUT come from 20% of your INPUT. ( forgive me highly paraphrased but effective!).
<b>This App allows you to focus on getting the "20%" done; so that you get MAX Results instead of procrastinating.</b><br/>
<h2>How??</h2>
By asking you 1 very Important Question Everyday: <i>If you could get only 3 things done today, what would they be?</i><br>

<h2>PS:</h2>
The App runs on <a href = "http://appengine.google.com">Google AppEngine</a>

<ul>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>HTML</li>

</ul>

<h2>PPS:</h2>
